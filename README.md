Project description
> The project initially aimed to create an innovative e-commerce bookstore that integrates a blockchain-based staking dApp. By leveraging a proof-of-stake (PoS) or similar consensus mechanism, users could stake their cryptocurrency tokens to earn rewards, which could then be used to purchase books. This project sought to enhance user engagement, provide a novel way to earn and spend cryptocurrency, and create a seamless integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) within the e-commerce space. However, due to certain challenges, the current focus has been solely on the staking section.

my staking project allows users to stake a specific token (stakingToken) and earn rewards in another token (rewardToken) based on their staked amount and the time they have staked. 
>Scenario
  - A user stakes a certain amount of the staking token by calling the stake function.
  -The user accumulates rewards over time based on the REWARD_RATE.
  -The user can withdraw their staked tokens at any time by calling the withdraw function.
  -The user can claim their rewards by calling the getReward function.
